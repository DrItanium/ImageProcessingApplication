This project is a sanitized version of my image processing application from my
Image Processing class in my CS Masters Program. 

The private version of this program was written back in Fall 2011.
The core program only contains filters that would not work in another
application domain. All other filters are defined in separate libraries which
are loaded dynamically by the core program at runtime only if they are tagged
with the proper attributes. 

Application domains are used to make it possible to reload plugins without
having to restart the application. I had to go to some strange lengths to get
this to work by adding layers of indirection. However, the program is
relatively stable but if you use it and find bugs then don't hesitate to file
bug reports. 

I really cleaned up this program for public consumption to make it far less of
a pain in the ass to compile and use. 

Since 2013-03-16, this program also supports the dynamic declaration of custom
file format loaders and savers. This feature is implemented as a second
application domain. 

I am in the process of rewriting large portions of this program to:
1) Speed up the compilation process by merging all libraries in lib into a
single Cortex.dll
2) Support filter application on full-color images without loss of color.
(Currently greyscale images are the only thing supported)


These two changes are large enough to warrant version 2.
